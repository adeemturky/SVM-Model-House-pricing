The "Social Network Ads" dataset contains information about individual users and their interactions with social network advertising. The dataset includes user attributes, such as age and estimated salary, as well as whether each user purchased a product or not. And the dataset contains 400 rows and 5 columns.

#Results:
our model achieved 0.80 accuracy then with scaler
function, we improved the performance to 0.93, which enhanced
our model.
We also have a 0.96 and 0.88 percentage for the labels in
precision which measures how often the model correctly
predicts the positive class.
On the recall testing which is the ability of a classification
model to identify all data points in a
relevant class our model 0.94 and 0.91 this is considered an
almost good percentage.
Last test result is the f1-score those measures of the harmonic
mean of precision and recall, our model got 0.95 and 0.89 and
this shows reasonable overall performance of a binary
classification. The confusion matrix shows the number of
instances predicted correctly for
example, [64, 4] first cell of the 2-dimential array (class zero)
Page 15 of 17
means 64 predicted right as class
zero and 4 means predicted false as class one, which is quite
good.
